# To create the oft-used algorithm you:
#
# Modified Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm to include a path and target.
# Added the Manhattan heuristic to use for estimating distance on a grid.
# Changed the Manhattan heuristic to the Euclidean heuristic to estimate distances between cities.
#
# Manhattan Heuristic : x_distance + y_distance
#
# Euclidean Heuristic : sqrt(x_distance * x_distance + y_distance * y_distance)
