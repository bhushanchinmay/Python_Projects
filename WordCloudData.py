# In our solution, we make three decisions:
#
# 1.  We use a class. This allows us to tie our methods together, calling them 
#   on instances of our class instead of passing references.
# 2. To handle duplicate words with different cases, we choose to make a word 
#   uppercase in our dictionary only if it is always uppercase in the original 
#   string. While this is a reasonable approach, it is imperfect (consider proper 
#   nouns that are also lowercase words, like "Bill" and "bill").
# 3. We build our own split_words() method instead of using a built-in one. This 
#   allows us to pass each word to our add_word_to_dictionary() method as it was split, 
#   and to split words and eliminate punctuation in one iteration.
#
# To split the words in the input string and populate a dictionary of the unique words to 
# the number of times they occurred, we:
#
# 1. Split words by spaces, em dashes, and ellipsesâ€”making sure to include hyphens surrounded 
#     by characters. We also include all apostrophes (which will handle contractions nicely 
#     but will break possessives into separate words).
# 2. Populate the words in our dictionary as they are identified, checking if the word is 
#     already in our dictionary in its current case or another case.
# 3. If the input word is uppercase and there's a lowercase version in the dictionary, 
#     we increment the lowercase version's count. If the input word is lowercase and there's 
#     an uppercase version in the dictionary, we "demote" the uppercase version by adding the 
#     lowercase version and giving it the uppercase version's count.
# 
# Runtime and memory cost are both O(n)O(n). This is the best we can do because we have to 
# look at every character in the input string and we have to return a dictionary of every 
# unique word. We optimized to only make one pass over our input and have only one O(n) data 
# structure.
